Through special training from the Shaolin Nung Si school of thought, Oxalis guides are gaining valuable knowledge to care for their health, reduce the risk of injury, and build mental resilience in any situation. This ensures a safe and fulfilling experience for all adventurers who join Oxalis Adventure.
Fifteen of our guides participated in a special physiotherapy course, part of our annual training activities, aimed at relieving muscle and joint pain—especially in the shoulder and neck areas—and helping them recover after challenging treks through forests and rivers.
The two-week therapy course was led by Master Long Phi Su. Before starting, the masters used energy flow techniques, combined with massage and acupressure, to address pain in the shoulders, neck, and joints. Following that, the guides were taught 21 exercises to help restore their bodies.
